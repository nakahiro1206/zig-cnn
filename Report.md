## Final Report of Machine Learning for Multimedia Processing

### Chosen Assignment: 1

### Problem Setting

The problem I tackled on this asssignment was to implement CNN algorithm from scratch in Zig programming language.
I apply this CNN model for solving [kuzushiji-MNIST](https://github.com/rois-codh/kmnist) image classification problem(https://codh.rois.ac.jp/kmnist/index.html.en).

### Brief introduction of the selected one
what is zig? what is kuzushiji?

#### Agenda
To fulfill the required implementation, I referred to [`vzhou842/cnn-from-scratch` GitHub repository](https://github.com/vzhou842/cnn-from-scratch), which implements CNN basic algorithm only with `numpy` in Python. According to the source code, I tried to implement them in Zig.

I also referred to [`albert-yu/mnist` GitHub repository](https://github.com/albert-yu/mnist) for downloading MNIST dataset and benchmark solution implemented `keras` library in Python.\
I set this benchmark CNN model as the initial goal for my implementation.

#### About AI Usage
However, I'm not so familiar with Zig nor CNN, and there is still no previous repository on GitHub that implemeted CNN in Zig. So, I completed this implementation with a big help of ChatGPT and Copilot. Due to insufficient online resources that should be used for training, I even struggled to implement it after all though.
